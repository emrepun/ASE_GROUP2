# **Project Plan**

# Organisation Plan

## Roles

Group leader will be Jim Fielding. Their responsibility in this role is to serve as the main point of communication with the customer (Martin Berger). This will include submitting deliverables as tagged branches by email, organising and performing demonstrations of deliverables and/or SE tools used and acting as a spokesperson
for any questions that the team may have regarding the requirements of a deliverable.

The group leader will also act as a project manager with the responsibility of ensuring that all deadlines are met and that resource allocation is fit for task. 

Each deliverable will be delivered as both an iOS and an Android application to give the user greater exposure across the mobile market. Given the size of the team, 6, the the roles will be divided as follows:


**iOS**
* Emre Havan (Mentor)
* Jim Fielding

**Android**
* Michael W Zintl (Mentor)
* Tiara Alfreida

**Cross-Platform**
* Flavius Morariu

**Backend**
* Rohan Bhayana

**UI**
* Tiara Alfreida

**Documentation**
* Jim Fielding
* Flavius Morariu
* Rohan Bhayana

**QA**
* Emre Havan
* Michael W Zintl
* Tiara Alfreida

The responsibilities of these roles are as follows:

**iOS**
* Deliver an iOS application for a set deadline that follows a given UI and requirements specification
* Perform inter-team code review to ensure a coding standard is maintained, requirements are met and that all code functions as expected
* Provide an automated test suite that can be run after any changes are made, providing constant integration testing

**Android**
* Deliver an Android application for a set deadline that follows a given UI and requirements specification
* Perform inter-team code review to ensure a coding standard is maintained, requirements are met and that all code functions as expected
* Provide an automated test suite that can be run after any changes are made, providing constant integration testing

**Cross-Platform**
* Provide an additional coding resource for the Android or iOS team where necessary
* Perform code review across iOS and Android application to give both an objective eye alongside the ability to provide feedback between the two development teams to eliminate discrepancies

**All Development Teams**
* Enter inter-team discussion whenever changes to test suites occur to ensure that the testing performed in both applications is mirrored to prevent discrepancies in the functionality of the two platform dependent applications

**Backend**
* A large data set is expected as part of this project, this role will involve analysing this data set and extrapolating useful information from it
* A server side back end will be deployed that provides the processing of this data set
* Further resources can be allocated here if necessary when the scope of the data set and task is realised

**UI**
* Provide storyboard prototypes that can be passed onto the development teams to ensure that HCI principles are not violated and that their is consistency across the two platform dependent applications

**Documentation**
* Perform a requirements discovery and analysis cycle each time the customer provides new information to the team leader, be this feedback or a new deliverable
* Provide use-case, flow and state-diagrams on the back of requirements analysis to be used by the development teams
* More resources to be allocated here where appropriate as the scope of the project is realised

**QA**
* Perform user-testing on the deliverables before they are finalised. This will be done cross-platform, involving members of both developments teams and the UI team to ensure that there is consistency across both implementations. All other testing is the responsibility of the respective development team.


## Methodology

Given the length of the project and the scope for change in this small window, an AGILE methodology will be used in regards to all project aspects.
Milestones will set as the deliverance of each deliverable across the duration of the project.
Smaller deadlines will be set to ensure that each milestone is met within good time.
Each milestone can be considered an epic which itself can be broken down into its component tasks. This will be facilitated using Waffle.io Kanban boards integrated with GitHub.

To facilitate the automation available in Waffle.io all new found requirements and tasks will first be recorded in GitHub as issues (tagged as an enhancement unless inappropriate). This will allow automated Kanban card movements as pull requests are created and issues are resolved

### Kanban Structure

Each Kanban board will have the following structure (some columns may be of less importance when considering documentation and not code):

1. Inbox
2. Backlog
3. In Progress
4. Review
5. Done


### Code Standards

The development teams will adopt a universal coding standard. A part of code review will be to ensure that these standards are met

Enforcing these standards will ensure that code is readable across all members of the team

These coding standards will be available through project Wiki as integrated into GitHub making them easily accessible by all members of the team

A pull request will not be approved if it fails to conform to these coding standards

### Branching Standards

The GitFlow Branching model will be used as a base
With this as a base, a more specific naming convention can be utilised for each task

Using the GitHub 'Issues' tab, each issue is given a number. Using that number, the task title (perhaps abbreviated if too verbose) and the task assignee's name a branch name can be formed

A sample branch name would be #42_Task-name-here_robert

### Project Wiki

A project Wiki will be developed and available directly through the Github Repository this will act as a centralised place to store information regarding:
* Coding standards
* Branching standards
* Requirements documents
* Design documentation
* UI Design and Prototypes




# Conflict Resolution Plan

In the event that a conflict arises the following protocol will be followed:

**Step 1**
Take a 5 minute break, be that getting a drink, going for a walk etc...

**Step 2**
A meeting of those involves in the conflict will be held including a mediator.
The mediator shall be chosen with the following priority:
1. Project Manager (Jim Fielding)
2. A member of the team who's sub-team is not involved in the conflict
3. A member of the involved team who is not directly involved in the conflict/can act objectively

**Step 3**
Each side of the conflict will be given a window of up to 2 minutes to present their side of the argument and where their conflict lies (uninterrupted)

**Step 4**
Mediator can question both sides, once understanding their point of view (again answering should remain uninterrupted), and propose some form of resolution(s)

**Step 5**
If a resolution can not be met in the above manner, then all members of the team can side democratically with one side or the other

**Step 6**
Team will proceed with desired resolution. Conflict to be left resolved


To prevent conflict before it arises the following procedure should be followed:
* A team meeting will be scheduled at least once a week for all members (Thursday 5-7pm)
* If necessary an additional team meeting can be scheduled at a time most suitable. If this time cannot be found, a team best for the majority will be chosen and all meeting will be summarised in note form, available in a shared Google Drive Folder, by a nominated scribe per meeting

Each meeting will have a structured agenda

### Agenda Structure

1. Interesting progress since last meeting (summarised by each team in 20 seconds)
2. What is halting your progress since last meeting (summarised by each team in 20 seconds)
3. Time to discuss the reallocation of resources or to resolve a possible conflict as a result of point 2
4. Goals/small milestones to be achieved by next meeting (summarised by each team in
20 seconds)
5. Opportunity for discussion around points submitted to be part of the agenda before the meeting
6. Meetings should not last longer than 15 minutes


Each team should also partake in small meeting several times a week, this can be in person or facilitated through a virtual chat medium (Discord)

Each member should provide a succinct answer to what they have achieved, this should be no more than the relevant tag heading of a given task on the Kanban board

This conversation should prioritise what is currently halting progress. This will give the more experiences mentors in each team the chance to guide the other member of the team to a resolution

In the result that this concluded in a widespread issue or block on progress this can be submitted to the agenda for the next meeting unless urgent, to allow for resource reallocation

In the event of a critical issue or emergency arising from any of the above, if an emergency meeting is not feasible, all members will engage in structured discussion
using Discord




# Peer Assessment Plan

The peer assessment will reflect each team members ability to function in their role across the whole project. This includes the responsibilities as detailed in the organisation plan. If each member of the team has performed their roles as described and completed all assigned tasks before a given deadline, then peer assessment marks should be distributed evenly. That said, if a team member's progress is blocked by an issue, or over-zealous workload, a team member will not be punished for requesting mentoring or a reallocation of resources

The function of the team is to complete every deliverable, this may result in some members of the team performing less/more of the work for a given  deliverable dependent on its scope and their role. Therefore, roles will be revised if the scope of the project leaves a team member with less to contribute across all
deliverables

In the event that a member of the team has to drop out due to illness etc... if they remain as part of the team as the project draws to a close (i.e. have not dropped
out) then they will be allocated marks reflective of the percentage and quality of work performed. Dependent on when this occurs, this is likely to be a fraction of the
score given to other members of the team

If a team member's output drops off but they remain present, making an even allocation of points infeasible, then each member of the team will provide a peer review of
all other members and an average taken. Given that this is an average, the result is democratic and therefore conflict should not arise. If for any reason a member of the
team feels that their mark is unjust, these members can present their case to the rest of the team in a final meeting to allow for reconsideration if contributions were
overlooked during the original distribution of marks

In this event the quality of the below criteria will be used to generate the mark allocation:

* Quality of work
* Interest in the project
* Overall level of participation
* Understanding what is required
* Suggesting ideas
* Extracting something useful from the ideas
* Performing routine tasks
* Consolidating (e.g. drawing things together)
* Keeping the group going when things are rough
* Sorting out problems
* Initiative: Generating ideas for the activities and methods of solution; Finding ideas from other sources
* Commitment: Doing a fair share of the work, meeting deadlines, attending meetings
and being punctual
* Conducive group behaviour: Allowing other members to have a fair chance to contribute; Responding constructively to each other's contributions

In the event that a team member feels a specific member has marked them unjustly due to a 1-on-1 conflict, a mediator will look at the conflict and decide appropriately
as defined in the conflict resolution section above
